I always liked the idea of having dedicated voice channels, especially one for when playing - I don't want people to randomly drop in and remove my focus. So as a small exercise I wanted to create a bot that could move users who opened a game, allowing us lazy bastards to never having to think about moving around.

This project was meant as an exercise in Python, but I realised that in my quest for becoming skilled in frontend development, it would make more sense to use JavaScript for this.

As of 14/09/19 I am having trouble getting the bot to do what I want. The functionality is there - at least a basic version - but I can't get the status to display right. It gives me the user's status before the update happened, meaning it sets things in motion when it's too late. I can see that the documentation describes "newMember" which should work, but I am unsure how to handle that parameter.
